excerpt: "<br> about Gallo <br>and the Podcast _Sucias are my Favorite_"
---

# 

Gallo, a Texan, former intercourse addict and widower currently resides in Reno, Nevada.

His focus is public speaking and his podcast, _Sucias are my Favorite_, sharing his story and educating others to have more success in dating, thriving relationships with their significant other and a more fulfilling sex life. Gallo believes that if we as a society can be more satisfied with ourselves, we can be happier in all our relationships and ultimately better as a community. 

For decades, Gallo exemplified the life he was taught and raised to live. To be successful with women, provide for his family and protect those closest to him. With the understanding of the unspoken rule "keep your family happy and you can have your fun on the side." By 19 he fell into the Lifestyle with one of his partners and discovered the BDsM community by chance. Though his friends saw him as a _Ladies Man_ he was unaware that he was in fact an intercourse addict
