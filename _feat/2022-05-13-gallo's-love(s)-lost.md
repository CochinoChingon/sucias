My favorite Sucias Gallo - I'm probably saying that or using it wrong... but I don't remember the Spanish lesson he taught me. Gallo joins me for an episode where I've wanted to explore Lost Loves, or Love Lost. He was kind enough to share his 2 stories with me! Let's sit back and let Gallo take the reigns and tell us how a former Intercourse Addict was able to find love in the deep south. Gallo's Podcast - Sucias Are My Favorite
