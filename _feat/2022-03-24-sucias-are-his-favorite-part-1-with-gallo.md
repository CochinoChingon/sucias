Gallo is in the house and he's breaking down the benefits of CBG, CBN for dealing with injuries that common Western medicine can't handle!

We also discussed the Tejano-no rule, his time working for Tesla, and what to do when your motorcycle starts acting like a little bitch and tries to kill you!

Gallo is a Dom in the world of BDSM, so be on the lookout for the next episode where we dive into the life of a REAL Dom and how to avoid the punk-ass posers in the world of BDSM!  This episode will give you something to talk about - money back guarantee!

Gallo is a straight-shooter and the podcast world needs more people like him!  He doesn't pull punches <insert corny BDSM joke here>!
