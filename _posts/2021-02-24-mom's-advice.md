This episode was an impromptu livestream where I allowed the viewers to pick a Card labeled A, B and C which I had written a topic on the back of each. The selected card was "best advice I got from my mom" and so I rambled on for about 30 minutes and this is what I ended up with, after dealing with some technical difficulties and removing excessive silence.
